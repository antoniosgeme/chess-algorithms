Can I build a chess engine that can beat me in chess? (~1900 ELO)
 

Rules:

- To start, no neural networks allowed. 
- Only hardcoding chess "knowledge". (IBM Deep Blue style)
- No opening handbooks allowed (although if its first few moves are terrible I might have to relax this a bit)


Status: **No**


The pygame GUI implementation is largely inspired by Eddie Sharick's tutorials on youtube. 
He has a great series on creating a python chess engine, although here the python-chess package is used.
